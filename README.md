## About the project

When creating this project, I was looking for a way to orgnanize my files more efficiently, I came up with macOS tags, they were amazing, however, I spent
most of my day in the terminal, so having way to manage them from the terminal would be amazing. I came up across some old tools, that didn't full fill my
what I was looking for.

So I decied to write my own tools for this (you can find then here) however, since I wanted to write them in Golang, and the only way to manage macOS tags without
the code looking ugly was in Obj-C I ended up writting a library in Obj-C that I could later call from Golang (This is my first time writting Obj-C).
